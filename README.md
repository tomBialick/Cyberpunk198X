# Cyberpunk198X
This is an attempt at making a "Roll20" like dm and player interface but one I
can control and is free for me. Likely to be a complete failure, but hey, I am
bored with quarantine.  

Based off of the [Fate Core system](#https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/) but
set in a distinctly cyberpunk setting. Most mechanics on the backend won't be too
biased towards cyberpunk and will likely be fairly agnostic to themes, but the
frontend will be very biased. If there is legitimate public interest and this
goes beyond just a tool for my friends and I, I will make it more flexible, or add
other themes.

## Motivation  
Dice rolling and combat are super tedious and prone to fudging. Plus, did you
remember your modifiers? Did that player accidentally stack when they shouldn't?
Wait what about that thug NPC, what's on that sheet? This will make it a click on
the user side (GM and player) so that focus can be on the story and the world, not
not the trivial matters that consume a lot of time and don't offer much enjoyment
to the people involved.
